A privacy hardened daily use browser install guide.

The spectrum of how privacy hardened you want your browser to be (aka, your threat model) can vary greatly. This install is probably the most extreme you can get while still having a browser functional enough to be a daily user.


## About fingerprinting
Info about fingerprinting (you should read this!): https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.3-Overrides-%5BTo-RFP-or-Not%5D
Basic explanation of what fingerprinting is: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/learn

This install uses Resist Fingerprinting (RFP).
RFP can break some functions, you should read the "ðŸŸª RFP" section of this page in it's entirety: https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/wiki/3.3-Overrides-%5BTo-RFP-or-Not%5D#-rfp
In summary:
- RFP can break websites by masking the canvas, which causes a glitchy, colorful, wavy visual bug. You can easily set a permanent or temporary site exception by clicking the canvas button that appears when a site requests your canvas size, or by doing `Ctrl-I > Permissions > Extract canvas data`
- RFP makes it so your timezone is always UTC0
- RFP makes it so that you always use the light theme

For times when your threat model does demand that you are not fingerprinted at all, you can either use the Tor browser or Mullvad Browser in conjunction with a VPN (doesn't have to be Mullvad VPN.)
